<h4>Discussion</h4>

<h5>Program Behavior</h5>

<p>This is a simple heap challenge using <code>libc-2.27.so</code>. The application gives three functions - allocate and immediately write to a chunk, delete a chunk, and print a chunk. We have 8 available chunks, labeled <code>0..7</code>. There are a couple of exploitable vulnerabilities, but the overarching problem is use-after-free (UAF). After freeing the chunk, the application fails to clear that chunk's address from memory, allowing us to (1) read a deleted chunk, giving us the ability to bypass ASLR and (2) <i>doubly</i> free a chunk.</p>

<p class = "caption">Figure 1. The chunks are freed, but they aren't cleared from memory.</p>

<p>While the UAF bug is dangerous, it does limit us in one way: the heap pointers are not zeroed out and the allocate function calls <code>malloc()</code> only if a pointer is zero, so we are limited to 8 chunks that can be allocated in total (regardless of whether they are freed). It turns out this is not a problem; in fact, we can (comfortably) perform this exploit with as few as 5 chunks.</p>

<h5>Information Leaks</h5>

<p>Our strategy will be to overwrite <code>__free_hook</code> with <code>system()</code> and subsequently <code>free()</code> a chunk containing <code>/bin/sh</code>. To do this, we need the address of <code>libc</code>. (I also leaked the heap address but this is completely unnecessary for the exploit.) We can get that address by reading a chunk that has been freed to a non-tcache bin, say, unsorted bin. The largest tcache bin holds chunks of size <code>0x410</code>, so if we allocate and free a chunk of size <code>0x420</code> (say, by requesting 0x418 = 1048 bytes), it will be inserted in the unsorted bin. Of course, to prevent merging with the top chunk, we need to allocate another chunk above it - its size does not matter. Upon freeing, the unsorted bin will be as follows:</p>

<p><code>libc.unsorted <=> [large chunk]</code></p>

<p>where the chunk's forward pointer points to <code>libc.unsorted</code>. Reading this chunk after it's freed and subtracting the offset of the unsorted bins gives the required leak.</p>

<h5>Double Free, Tcache Poisoning, and Arbitrary Write to Free Hook</h5>

<p>Consider the following sequence of operations:</p>

<ol>
    <li><p>Allocate a small chunk in tcache, say of size 0x30 (request 0x28 bytes). Alternatively, to save a chunk, we can just use the chunk that prevented merging with the top chunk in the leak step above.</p></li>
    <li>
        <p>Delete this chunk, resulting in the following tcache state</p>
        <p><code>tcache[0x30] -> [small chunk] -> NULL</code></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Delete this chunk, again (double free). The tcache now looks like</p>
        <p><code>tcache[0x30] -> [small chunk] -> [small chunk] -> NULL</code></p>
        <p>Note that <code>libc-2.27.so</code> does not have checks for double free in tcaches.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Request a chunk of size 0x28. It will be serviced from the head of this tcache. The tcache is now back to</p>
        <p><code>tcache[0x30] -> [small chunk] -> NULL</code></p>
        <p>but importantly, we control a chunk that is the next in line to be <code>malloc()</code>ed from this bin. We now write the address of <code>__free_hook</code> to the first 8 bytes of this chunk; this <i>poisons</i> the tcache so that it is now</p>
        <p><code>tcache[0x30] -> [small chunk] -> __free_hook -> NULL</code></p>
        <p>(Note that the fake chunk at <code>__free_hook</code> points to NULL, since it has not been initialized. But this doesn't matter for our exploit.)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Again, request a chunk of size 0x28. Note that it will return the same small chunk as before. Write <code>/bin/sh</code> to this chunk. Note that by the time we receive this chunk, tcache has already been updated to</p>
        <p><code>tcache[0x30] -> __free_hook -> NULL</code></p>
        <p>so we do not need to preserve the address of <code>__free_hook</code> in this chunk.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Request another chunk of size 0x28. It will return the fake chunk at <code>__free_hook</code>, which we overwrite with <code>system()</code>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Delete the small chunk, which will <code>free([small chunk] -> "/bin/sh")</code>, prompting the free hook to call <code>system("/bin/sh")</code>. We now have a shell.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
