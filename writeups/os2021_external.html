<h2>Binary Exploitation - 467 pts</h2>

<h3>Writeup by YR81</h3>

<h4>Discussion</h4>

<h5>Program Behavior</h5>

<p>This challenge was rather unique. Let's take a look at what the binary does. It first prints <code>ROP me ;)</code> and reads 0xf0 = 240 characters to a buffer located at <code>rbp - 0x50</code> - clearly, we need to overflow it and craft a ROP chain. However, after the buffer is read, the GOT is cleared!</p>

<p class = "caption">Figure 1. The <code>main()</code> procedure in this challenge.</p>

<p>In a typical ROP exploit, we could just return to a gadget that loads a pointer into <code>rdi</code> and calls a libc function to print an address. However, that won't be possible here since the references to the libc function symbols are destroyed. However, not <i>all</i> of them are gone. We still have access to, for instance, <code>__libc_start_main</code>. Furthermore, we have a <code>write()</code> syscall gadget that can be used to perform arbitrary writes after libc is no longer accessible.</p>

<h5>ROP Exploit</h5>

<p>A first attempt at a payload would be to find a ROP chain that performs <code>execve("/bin/sh", NULL, NULL)</code>. But without any gadgets in libc and the limited gadgets in the program text, this is infeasible. Instead, we will take advantage of the remaining libc references and <i>reconstruct</i> the global offset table (of course with the side effect of leaking libc). We can do this as follows.</p>

<ol>
    <li><p>Perform syscall <code>write(stdout, __libc_start_main_got, 0x38)</code>. Note that the number of bytes to write (<code>rdx = 0x38</code>) is set in <code>clear_got</code>, which is sufficient (we actually only need 6, at most 8).</p></li>
    <li><p>Perform syscall <code>read(stdin, puts_got, 0x38)</code>. We will submit the addresses of the libc functions that were deleted.</p></li>
    <li><p>Return to <code>main()</code>, now functioning correctly with libc references reloaded and knowledge of the libc address.</p></li>
    <li><p>Proceed with classic ROP-ret2libc exploit.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>However, there is a slight problem with this approach - there is no way to adjust <code>rax</code> to execute the <code>read()</code> syscall (<code>rax = 0</code>). The return value from the <code>write()</code> syscall should just be 0x38, the number of characters passed via <code>rdx</code>. There are no clear gadgets to adjust <code>rax</code>. This is where intuition - actually, mostly luck - comes in: when there aren't any short gadgets that will do the job, we can look for function gadgets. In this case, consider <code>init_proc()</code> shown below:</p>

<img src = "./images/os2021_external_2.png">

<p class = "caption">Figure 2. A useful gadget that will set <code>rax</code> to 0 to allow for a <code>read()</code> syscall.</p>

<p>It loads a value into <code>rax</code> (promising!) from <code>__gmon_start___ptr</code>. After doing <a href = "https://stackoverflow.com/a/12697864/5740793" target = "_blank">looking around</a> a bit, we learn that this pointer is to a function that initializes gmon profiling - a tool that measures the execution speed of different parts of a program. However, if gmon is not in use (as it probably is not here), then this pointer will be NULL. This is precisely what we need!</p>

<p>After leaking libc, we can recover the addresses of the functions that were cleared from the GOT and safely return to <code>main()</code>, this time with the additional knowledge of where <code>system()</code> and the string <code>/bin/sh</code> are in memory.</p>
