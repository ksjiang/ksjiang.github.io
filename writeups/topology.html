<h4>Compact Spaces</h4>

<p><i>Definition.</i> A <i>compact space</i> is one for which every (open) cover has a finite subcover.</p>

<p><i>Proposition.</i> A closed subspace of a compact space is compact.</p>

<p><i>Proof.</i> Let <code>X</code> be a compact space, and let <code>A</code> be closed in <code>X</code>. Let <code>A_j</code>, with <code>j</code> indexing over an index set <code>J</code>, be a (open) cover of <code>A</code>. For each <code>j</code>, since <code>A_j</code> is open in <code>A</code>, there exists an open set <code>B_j</code> such that <code>A_j</code> is equal to the intersection of <code>A</code> with <code>B_j</code>. The family <code>B_j</code> does not necessarily cover <code>X</code>. However, if we append the open set <code>X - A</code> to this family, then it does cover <code>X</code>. Since <code>X</code> is compact, there is a finite subfamily <code>C_k</code>, where <code>k</code> indexes over the positive integers <code>1</code> to <code>n</code>, of this family that covers <code>X</code>. Consider the finite subfamily constructed by taking <code>A</code> intersect <code>C_k</code> for each <code>k</code> such that <code>C_k</code> is not <code>X - A</code>. Each of these is an element of the original family <code>A_j</code>, and their union is <code>A</code>. Thus, <code>A</code> is compact.</p>

<p><i>Proposition.</i> A compact subspace of a Hausdorff space is closed.</p>

<p><i>Proof.</i> Let <code>X</code> be Hausdorff and <code>A</code> be a compact subspace of <code>X</code>. We show that the complement of <code>A</code>, <code>X - A</code>, is open. Consider a point <code>b</code> of <code>X - A</code>. For each point <code>a</code> in <code>A</code>, there exists disjoint (open) neighborhoods <code>U_a</code> of <code>a</code> and <code>V_a</code> of <code>b</code>. The family consisting of <code>A</code> intersected with <code>U_a</code> for each <code>a</code> in <code>A</code> is a cover of <code>A</code>; since <code>A</code> is compact, it has a finite subcover consisting of elements of the form <code>A</code> intersected with <code>U_{a_k}</code>, where <code>k</code> indexes over the positive integers <code>1</code> to <code>n</code>. Now, consider the finite intersection of neighborhoods <code>V_{a_k}</code> of <code>b</code>; it is a neighborhood of <code>b</code> that is disjoint from <code>A</code> (note that <code>A</code> is contained in the union of <code>U_{a_k}</code>, which is disjoint from the intsection of <code>V_{a_k}</code>) and thus is contained in <code>X - A</code>.</p>
